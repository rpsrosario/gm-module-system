#region Configuration Options

///
/// Whether extended integrity checks should be compiled into the module system
/// or not.
///
/// Enabling this option will include a series of checks that were devised to
/// ensure the integrity of the module system as well as provide to the user
/// explicit error messages whenever such integrity is violated. This means
/// that these checks may have a significant impact on the game, therefore it
/// is recommended that such checks are disabled on production builds of the
/// game. Otherwise it is recommended to keep these checks enabled on debug
/// builds of the game unless the performance impact is critical. If that is
/// the case then at the very least enable the checks when writing/updating
/// code that makes active use of the module system so as to ensure proper
/// usage.
///
/// Note: This should be set to a compile time boolean constant, otherwise
/// unwanted side effects may occur.
